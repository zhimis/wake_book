# Wakeboarding Park Booking System - MVP Requirements Prompt

## Overview
Develop a mobile-first web application for a wakeboarding park with a 2-tower system that allows one rider at a time. The system will enable customers to view available time slots, book sessions, and provide administrators with management capabilities. The application should be designed as a responsive web app with potential for PWA functionality.

## Core Functionality

### User Roles
1. **Customers** - People who want to book wakeboarding sessions
2. **Administrators** - Staff who manage the booking system, time slots, and pricing

### Customer Features

#### 1. Calendar View
- Display a weekly calendar view with time slots divided into 30-minute increments
- Clearly indicate price for each time slot
- Show availability status (available, booked, reserved)
- Allow customers to select multiple consecutive time slots before proceeding to booking
- Implement responsive design optimized for mobile devices
- Limit calendar visibility to maximum 1 month ahead
- Include current week's weather forecast integration

#### 2. Detailed Booking Flow
1. **Calendar Browsing**
   - User views calendar with available slots
   - Days are displayed in a week view with easy navigation between weeks
   - Each slot shows availability and price
   - Weather forecast displayed for current week

2. **Slot Selection**
   - User taps/clicks available time slot(s)
   - Selected slot changes color to indicate selection
   - Selected slot is locked for other users for 10 minutes
   - Visual countdown timer showing reservation expiration
   - Warning notification when 2 minutes remain
   - Clear indication of total time and cost at bottom of screen
   - "Proceed to Booking" button becomes active after selection

3. **Booking Form**
   - Simple form collecting:
     - Full name (required)
     - Phone number (required, with validation)
   - Clear display of selected time slots and total cost
   - Options to edit selections or return to calendar

4. **Confirmation**
   - Review screen showing all booking details
   - "Confirm Booking" button
   - On successful booking:
     - Success message with booking reference
     - Option to add to calendar
     - SMS confirmation sent to provided phone number

5. **Conflict Resolution**
   - When a user selects a time slot, it's locked for 10 minutes
   - Visual indication (different color/pattern) for temporarily locked slots
   - Other users cannot select locked slots
   - If booking not completed within 10 minutes:
     - Warning notification shown to user
     - Slots released back to available pool automatically
     - User returned to selection screen if they attempt to proceed

### Administrator Features

#### 1. Booking Management
- View all bookings in calendar format (similar to customer view)
- Access detailed information for each booking
- Ability to modify existing bookings (change time, adjust details)
- Ability to delete bookings
- Manually create bookings for customers (phone bookings)
- Mark slots as unavailable (maintenance, private events, etc.)

#### 2. System Configuration
- Set standard operating hours for each day of the week (recurring schedule)
- Configure pricing for different time slots:
  - Standard pricing
  - Special pricing for peak hours, weekends, holidays
- Ability to override default availability for specific dates
- Set visibility timeframe for booking calendar (up to 1 month)

#### 3. Statistics Dashboard
- Booking load percentage (booked hours vs. total available hours)
- Daily, weekly, and monthly views
- Forecasted income based on confirmed bookings
- Popular booking times visualization
- Utilization rate by day of week
- Simple export functionality (CSV)

### Security Implementation
1. **Admin Authentication**
   - Secure login with username/password
   - Strong password requirements
   - Session timeout after period of inactivity (30 minutes)
   - IP-based login attempt limiting to prevent brute force attacks
   - HTTPS implementation for all data transfer

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption of customer personal data
   - Minimal data collection (only what's necessary)
   - Secure database configuration with proper access controls
   - Regular automated backups

3. **Booking Security**
   - Server-side validation of all booking requests
   - Confirmation of slot availability before finalizing booking
   - Transaction logging for all booking activities
   - CSRF protection on all forms

## Technical Considerations
1. **Mobile-First Design**
   - Responsive UI optimized for mobile devices
   - Touch-friendly interface for slot selection
   - Desktop version as an extension of mobile design
   - Simplified booking flow to minimize friction

2. **Compatibility**
   - Support for all modern mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
   - Cross-platform functionality on iOS and Android devices
   - Desktop browser compatibility
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for improved mobile experience

3. **Data Management**

   - Automatic time slot management to prevent double bookings
   - Data backup and recovery mechanisms

4. **Weather Integration**

   - Simple visual indicators for weather conditions

5. **Concurrent User Management**
   - Real-time slot status updates
   - Temporary reservation system (10-minute hold)
   - Graceful handling of reservation timeouts
   - Clear visual feedback on slot status

## Future Phases (Not in MVP)
1. Payment processing integration
2. User registration and login (including Google sign-in)
3. Automated booking reminders
4. Waitlist functionality for fully booked periods
5. Special pricing for returning customers or bulk bookings
6. Weather-based dynamic pricing
