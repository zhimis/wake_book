# Evaluating date-fns vs Luxon for Timezone Handling

## Overview

This document evaluates whether we should migrate from date-fns to Luxon for timezone handling in the Hi Wake 2.0 application. We'll compare both libraries based on specific requirements for this project.

## Current Approach with date-fns

We currently use a combination of:
- `date-fns` for general date manipulation 
- `date-fns-tz` for timezone-specific functionality

### Strengths of date-fns
- Modular API (we can import only what we need)
- Pure functions with immutable behavior
- Better bundle size for small projects
- Simple, functional approach
- Already integrated into our codebase
- Familiar to the development team

### Limitations of date-fns
- Less comprehensive timezone handling
- Requires separate `date-fns-tz` package
- No built-in comprehensive handling of DST edge cases
- Not as detailed with timezone information
- Occasional inconsistencies between different functions
- Less robust handling of timezone transitions

## Potential Migration to Luxon

Luxon is a powerful library built by one of the Moment.js maintainers, designed as a modern replacement.

### Strengths of Luxon
- First-class timezone support (built-in)
- DateTime objects are immutable
- More comprehensive DST handling
- Consistent chaining API for complex operations
- Better handling of invalid dates
- More detailed timezone information
- Better documentation for timezone use cases
- Built-in internationalization support

### Limitations of Luxon
- Larger bundle size
- Object-oriented API (vs. functional)
- Requires learning a new API
- Migration effort from existing code

## Key Considerations for Our Project

1. **DST Handling**: Latvia observes Daylight Saving Time transitions
   - Luxon provides more robust handling of edge cases during transitions

2. **International Bookings**: Customers may book from different timezones
   - Luxon offers clearer APIs for timezone conversions and display

3. **Date Formatting**: We need consistent formatting across timezones
   - Both libraries can handle this, but Luxon's API is more consistent

4. **Migration Effort**: Switching libraries requires changes to:
   - All client-side date handling components
   - All server-side date processing
   - Test cases and documentation
   
## Recommendation

**Short-term**: Continue with date-fns for Phase 3 implementation to avoid disruption.

**Medium-term**: Consider a phased migration to Luxon:
1. Create wrapped utility functions that can be implemented with either library
2. Gradually replace implementations with Luxon where beneficial
3. Eventually standardize on one approach across the codebase

**Long-term**: Evaluate the results of the migration and decide whether to complete the transition to Luxon.

### Migration Strategy

If we decide to migrate to Luxon, we should:
1. Create adapter functions to abstract date library details
2. Replace implementation without changing the exported API
3. Update one component at a time to minimize risk
4. Add comprehensive tests for timezone handling
5. Document the new approach for future maintenance

## Test Cases to Evaluate Libraries

The following test scenarios should be implemented to compare both libraries:

1. Converting between timezones (Latvia ↔ UTC ↔ User's local timezone)
2. Handling DST transition edge cases (bookings that span transitions)
3. Formatting dates with consistent timezone display
4. Performance testing with many date operations
5. Bundle size impact with both implementations
