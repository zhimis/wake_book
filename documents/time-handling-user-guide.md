# Timezone Handling - User Guide

## Understanding Time Display in Hi Wake 2.0

Hi Wake 2.0 operates in Latvia, where the timezone is:
- Europe/Riga (EET/EEST)
- UTC+2 during winter months
- UTC+3 during summer months (Daylight Saving Time)

## How Time is Displayed

All times displayed in the booking system are shown in **Latvia time**, regardless of your local timezone. If you're not located in Latvia, you'll see a timezone indicator "(Latvia time)" next to dates and times.

## Examples

- "15:00 (Latvia time)" means 3:00 PM in Latvia
- "Monday, May 5 (Latvia time)" refers to Monday in Latvia's timezone

## Time Conversion

The system automatically handles all timezone conversions for you. You don't need to manually convert times. For your convenience, timezones are clearly marked with indicators, and tooltips provide additional information when needed.

## Operating Hours

The wakeboarding park operates from 8:00 to 22:00 (Latvia time). All bookings must fall within these hours.

## Booking Confirmation

Your booking confirmation will include:
- The date and time of your booking in Latvia time

## Tips for International Users

- When planning your visit, remember that all times shown are in Latvia time
- If you're traveling from another timezone, make sure to account for the time difference
- The system will display a helpful timezone indicator if you're located outside Latvia
